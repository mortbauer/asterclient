# aster client default configuration, in order to work the ASTER_ROOT
# environment variable must be set to the code aster root environment variable
#
# the file format is yaml: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation
#
# you can also replace the quiet complicated looking stuff with absolute paths
# but actually this complicated looking stuff helps to keep the logic behind
# the scence very simple, so no magic is happening here. As a short
# aexplanation, the ``!!python/object/apply:os.getenv ["ASTER_ROOT"]`` just
# calls the ``os.getenv`` function with ``ASTER_ROOT`` as its argument. For
# more info look: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAMLDocumentation#Objects
