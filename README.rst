Simple Code Aster Client
########################

Asterclient serves as a simpler alternative to the as_run or astk clients of
`code aster`_. I created it out of frustration on as_run and astk as these
programs are poorly documented and quite complex and not very userfriendly in
my opinion but other opinions might differ. I also wanna state that i'm really
thankful to EDF for giving acces to code aster.
